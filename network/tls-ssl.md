# TLS and SSL

Both are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network (notably, websites can use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers, using the https protocol).

- Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which is now prohibited from use by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- Several versions of the protocols exist (current is TLS 1.2, draft 1.3)
- Widespread use in web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP)
