# J03 - Playing with CSS variables and JS

Native CSS variables should be declared within a CSS selector that defines its scope. For a global scope it's either the `:root` or the `body` selector.

Variable names must begin with two dashes (--) and are case sensitive.

Variables in native CSS mimick SASS/Less variables:

```
:root {
  --base: #ffc600;
  --spacing: 10px;
  --blur: 10px;
}

img {
  padding: var(--spacing);
  background: var(--base);
  filter: blur(var(--blur));
}
```

Note that calls are made keeping the `--` (instead of `$`)


`querySelectorAll` returns a NodeList object, a list (collection) of nodes extracted from a document.

It's not an array (no method for arrays like `map`, `reduce`, etc.). Only has a few ones: `keys`, `forEach`, etc.)

Some convert nodelists to arrays to get all the methods.


- `this.dataset` contains all the customs `data-*` attributes of an element:
- a variable can be set at the element level:

`<div style="--base: #BADASS">` will prevent the `--base` variable to be updated.
