# Intro

- each day's exercise can be done after watching the video in full, or at the same time, or without, depending on the challenge you look for
- there might be many ways to do things (since we use no closures, design patterns, frameworks, or any opiniated stuff in general)
- no jquery, lodash, underscore, etc., just plain vanilla JS

# J01 - JS Drum kit

- data-* attributes is used to define custom attribute:
`data-yolo="yulu"`

- `<audio data-key="65" src="sounds/clap.wav"></audio>` is used to **include** a sound (not playing it: that's the job of JS)

- `<kbd>` (Keyboard Input element) represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device (it's mostly a presentation tag)

- `window` vs `document`: `window.addEventListener` vs `document.querySelector`: the window is the document after rendering

- careful about having the focus on the window and not on the console! otherwise keypresses can't be caught

- audio elements need to be rewinded before played (otherwise you have to wait until they end to play them again):
`audio.currentTime = 0;`

- `element.classList.add('class-name')` to add a class to an element (cf. `remove` and `toggle`)

- can't set an `addeventListener` on an array: must iterate over the array and add the `addEventListener` on each:
`keys.forEach(key => key.addEventListener('transitionend', functionName(key)));`

- warning: `functionName` and `functionName()`: in the second case, we prevent a possible variable from being passed to the function, so:
`
function removeTransition(e) {
  console.log(e);
}
`
will show nothing if we do
`keys.forEach(key => key.addEventListener('transitionend', removeTransition()));`
instead of
`keys.forEach(key => key.addEventListener('transitionend', removeTransition));`
