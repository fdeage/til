# J05 - Flexboxes

- imbricating flexbox: flexbox = a flex container + flex items. But then each item can become a container by itself (by adding `display: flex;` to its CSS)
- `flex: n;` in the flex item will divide the entire flex container into as many parts as the total flex numbers
- `flex-direction: column;`
- Use `justify-content: center;` for horizontal alignment, use `align-items: center;` for vertical alignment.
